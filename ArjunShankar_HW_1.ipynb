        "Due to the complexity of the English language, identifying the ends of sentences and the number of syllables in a word can be tricky. To make these tasks manageable, we will make the following simplifications:\n",

        "\n",
        "* In general, we will assume that any sequence of consecutive vowels (including 'y') corresponds to a syllable. Thus, \"h**ea**v**y**\" has two syllables and \"**I**t**a**l**ia**n\" has three syllables. However, words whose last letter is an \"e\" are a special case. If the \"e\" is preceded by a vowel (e.g., \"tr**ee**\") or the letter \"l\" (e.g., \"wh**i**stl**e**\"), or if the \"e\" is the only vowel in the word (e.g., \"th**e**\"), then it counts as a syllable. Otherwise, the trailing \"e\" does not count as a syllable (e.g., \"sp**i**te\").\n",

        "> Define a function named `isEndOfSentence` that has a single word as input. The function should return `True` if the word ends in a period, exclamation point, or question mark (ignoring trailing quotation marks). For example, `isEndOfSentence(\"What?\")` should return `True`, while `isEndOfSentence(\"So,\")` should return `False`. *Hint:* to ignore trailing quotation marks, use the string `rstrip` method. For example, the following assignment will strip trailing quotation marks off of a word and save the resulting string in `stripped`:\n",

    "1. To the extent possible, **always use variables** in your answers.\n",
    "1. When a question provides a value for you to use in computations, **first store it in a variable and from that point onwards write code that makes use of that variable**. This is a good practice in programming: it allows you to write code that (except for the first couple of lines) is independent from the specific values provided to you. That makes it easy to update those external values later on if they ever change without having to modify your code, which is always an error-prone thing to do!\n",
    "1. Remember this is a programming course. :-) This means that the answers to all questions are meant to be **done in code** as much as possible. E.g., when a question reads \"*count the number of times that ...*\" you should interpret it as \"***write code that*** *counts the number of times that ...*\". Use your best judgment and you will do fine. :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: there are many ways to solve any programming assignment. If you wrote code that follows the instructions, uses variables (to the extent possible) and is valid Python code, you are entitled to full credit."

    "In the previous question, you were only asked to use the 10 planets returned by a first call to the API at http://swapi.dev/api/planets/. However, this API lists information about many more planets. What happened was that SWAPI (both for planets as well as for any other type of information) only serves 10 results at a time and then expects your code to send additional requests for the rest of the data, which will be served in \"batches\" of 10 results at a time. This is very common behavior \"in the real world\", since it avoids needlessly wasting bandwidth and server resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the data you get back is a dictionary that contains a key called 'next'. The value for that key is the URL to which you should send the next request using requests.get() to fetch the additional batch of information about the following 10 starships. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.1) Retrieve information about *all* starships available via this API and store it in a list called 'starships'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** As mentioned above, the typical way to fetch all results from an API is to use a while loop that will retrieve a batch of 10 results, add them to a list (or similar data structure) and then send another request for more results *if the value for the key 'next' in the dictionary in the previous response contained a URL*. When you retrieve the final batch of results and no more results are available, the server will send you a dictionary that will probably still contain results you need to add to the list but the value for key 'next' will be None (rather than a URL). Therefore, one common strategy is to have your while loop end when the value for key 'next' == None. Notice that None is a special value in Python (like True or False) and is *not* surrounded in quotes!\n",
